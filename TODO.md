# TODO

- ~~Add sound at the end of the session~~
  - [http://www.johnath.com/beep/beep.c] look here
  - **IT'S QUITE HARD TO DO THAT**
  - use the new `beep` function in code
- ~~Add automatic save/restore on quit~~
- ~~Add quit confirmation~~
- ~~Add possibility to pause/skip/restart~~
- Add custom values for time (maybe via argv)
- Center everything in terminal
- As not, it does not work at all
  - that's quite unfortunate
