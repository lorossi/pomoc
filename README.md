# Pomoc

While I should be studying, I am developing a little pomodoro timer to help me study.

That's ironic because it's taking me a lot of time. I don't even know what to do with my life anymore.

Basically I am using my own [library](https://github.com/lorossi/cli-gui) to handle all the windows in the terminal.

More on this project to come.
